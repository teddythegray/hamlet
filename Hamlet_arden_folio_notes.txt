2006 Arden Shakespeare Hamlet q2 
Folio Only Passages 

(1) F 2.2.238–2.2.267 (follows the equivalent of Q2 2.2.235 ‘true’)
Hamlet
… Let me question more in particular. What
have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of
Fortune that she sends you to prison hither?
Guildensterne
Prison, my lord?
Hamlet
Denmark’s a prison.
Rosincrance
Then is the world one.
Hamlet
A goodly one, in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons – Denmark being one o’th’
worst.
Rosincrance
We think not so, my lord.
Hamlet
Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. To me it
is a prison.
Rosincrance
Why, then your ambition makes it one: ’tis
too narrow for your mind.
Hamlet
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and
count myself a king of infinite space – were it not that
I have bad dreams.
467
Guildensterne
Which dreams, indeed, are ambition;
for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the
shadow of a dream.
Hamlet
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Rosincrance
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and
light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
Hamlet
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs
and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we
to th’ Court? For, by my fay, I cannot reason.
Rosincrance, Guildensterne
We’ll wait upon you.
Hamlet
No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man,
I am most dreadfully attended.
468
(2) F 2.2.335–2.2.360 (follows Q2 2.2.299)
Hamlet
How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
Rosincrance
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted
pace. But there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases
that cry out on the top of question and are most
tyrannically clapped for’t. These are now the fashion,
and so berattle the common stages (so they call them)
that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills
and dare scarce come thither.
Hamlet
What, are they children? Who maintains ’em?469
How are they escotted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards
if they should grow themselves to common players – as
it is most like if their means are no better – their
writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against
their own succession?
Rosincrance
Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to
controversy. There was for a while no money bid for
argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs
in the question.
Hamlet
Is’t possible?
470
Guildensterne
O, there has been much throwing about
of brains.
Hamlet
Do the boys carry it away?
Rosincrance
Ay, that they do, my lord – Hercules and
his load too.
471
(3) F 4.1.159–4.1.161 (follows Q2 4.5.159)
Laertes

… Nature is fine in love, and where ‘tis fine
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.
472
(4) F 5.2.68–5.2.81 (follows Q2 5.2.66)
Hamlet

… To quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damned
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil?
Horatio

It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.
Hamlet

 It will be short. The interim’s mine,
And a man’s life’s no more than to say one.
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself,
For by the image of my cause I see
473
The portraiture of his. I’ll count his favours;
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.
Enter young OSRICKE .
Horatio
Peace, who comes here?
