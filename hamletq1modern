The Tragical History of HAMLET Prince of Denmark.
[Scene 1]
Enter two Sentinels [First Sentinel and Barnardo].
First Sentinel
Stand! Who is that?
Barnardo
'Tis I.
First Sentinel
Oh, you come most carefully upon your watch.
Barnardo
An if you meet Marcellus and Horatio,
The partners of my watch, bid them make haste.
First Sentinel
I will. See who goes there.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
Horatio
Friends to this ground.
Marcellus
And liegemen to the Dane.
[To the First Sentinel] Oh, farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved you?
First Sentinel
Barnardo hath my place. Give you good night.
[Exit.]
Marcellus
Holla, Barnardo!
Barnardo
Say, is Horatio there?
Horatio
A piece of him.
Barnardo
Welcome, Horatio, welcome, good Marcellus.
Marcellus
What, hath this thing appeared again tonight?
Barnardo
I have seen nothing.
Marcellus
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him,
Touching this dreaded sight twice seen by us.
Therefore I have entreated him along with us
To watch the minutes of this night,
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes, and speak to it.
Horatio
Tut, 'twill not appear.
Barnardo
Sit down, I pray, and let us once again
Assail your ears, that are so fortified,
What we have two nights seen.
Horatio
Well, sit we down, and let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
Barnardo
Last night of all, when yonder star that's westward from the pole had made his course to
Illumine that part of heaven where now it burns,
The bell then tolling one--
Enter Ghost.
Marcellus
Break off your talk. See where it comes again!
Barnardo
In the same figure like the King that's dead.
Marcellus
Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.
Barnardo
Looks it not like the King?
Horatio
Most like. It horrors me with fear and wonder.
Barnardo
It would be spoke to.
Marcellus
 Question it, Horatio.
Horatio
What art thou that thus usurps the state in
Which the majesty of buried Denmark did sometimes
Walk? By heaven, I charge thee speak.
Marcellus
It is offended.
Exit Ghost.
Barnardo
See, it stalks away.
Horatio
Stay, speak, speak! By heaven, I charge thee speak!
Marcellus
'Tis gone and makes no answer.
Barnardo
How now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
Horatio
Afore my God, I might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of my own eyes.
Marcellus
Is it not like the King?
Horatio
As thou art to thyself.
Such was the very armor he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated.
So frowned he once, when in an angry parle
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
Marcellus
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk he passèd through our watch.
Horatio
In what particular to work, I know not,
But in the thought and scope of my opinion
This bodes some strange eruption to the state.
Marcellus
Good, now sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cost of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week:
What might be toward, that this sweaty march
Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?
Who is't that can inform me?
Horatio
Marry, that can I, at least the whisper goes so:
Our late King, who as you know was by
Fortenbrasse of Norway,
Thereto pricked on by a most emulous cause, dared to
The combat, in which our valiant Hamlet,
For so this side of our known world esteemed him,
Did slay this Fortenbrasse,
Who by a seale[d] compact, well ratified by law
And heraldry, did forfeit with his life all those
His lands which he stood seized of by the conqueror,
Against the which a moiety competent
Was gagèd by our King.
Now, sir, young Fortenbrasse,
Of inapprovèd mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Sharked up a sight of lawless resolutes
For food and diet to some enterprise,
That hath a stomach in't. And this (I take it) is the
Chief head and ground of this our watch.
Enter the Ghost.
But lo, behold, see where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may do ease to thee and grace to me,
Speak to me!
If thou are privy to thy country's fate,
Which happ'ly foreknowing may prevent, oh, speak to me!
Or if thou hast extorted in thy life,
Or hoarded treasure in the womb of earth,
For which they say you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak to me! Stay and speak, speak!--Stop it, Marcellus.
Barnardo
'Tis here.
Exit Ghost.
Horatio
'Tis here.
Marcellus
'Tis gone. Oh, we do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence,
For it is as the air invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
Barnardo
It was about to speak when the cock crew.
Horatio
And then it faded like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morning,
Doth with his early and shrill-crowing throat
Awake the god of day, and at his sound,
Whether in earth or air, in sea or fire,
The stravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confines; and of the truth hereof
This present object made probation.
Marcellus
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Savior's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long,
And then, they say, no spirit dare walk abroad,
The nights are wholesome, then no planet strikes,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So gracious and so hallowed is that time.
Horatio
So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
But see, the sun, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high mountain top.
Break we our watch up, and, by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen tonight
Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our love, fitting our duty?
Marcellus
Let's do't, I pray, and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
[Exeunt.]
[Scene 2]
Enter King, Queen, Hamlet, Laertes, Corambis, and the two Ambassadors, with Attendants.
King
Lords, we here have writ to Fortenbrasse,
Nephew to old Norway, who, impudent
And bed-rid, scarcely hears of this his
Nephew's purpose; and we here dispatch
Young good Cornelia, and you, Voltemar,
For bearers of these greetings to old
Norway, giving to you no further personal power
To business with the King
Than those related articles do show.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Gentlemen
In this and all things will we show our duty.
King
We doubt nothing. Heartily farewell.
[Exeunt Cornelia and Voltemar.]
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You said you had a suit. What is't, Laertes?
Laertes
My gracious lord, your favorable license,
Now that the funeral rites are all performed,
I may have leave to go again to France;
For though the favor of your grace might stay me,
Yet something is there whispers in my heart
Which makes my mind and spirits bend all for France.
King
Have you your father's leave, Laertes?
Corambis
He hath, my lord, wrung from me a forced grant,
And I beseech you grant your highness'leave.
King
With all our heart, Laertes, fare thee well.
Laertes
I in all love and duty take my leave.
Exit.
King
And now, princely son Hamlet,
What means these sad and melancholy moods?
For your intent going to Wittenberg,
We hold it most unmeet and unconvenient,
Being the joy and half heart of your mother.
Therefore let me entreat you stay in court,
All Denmark's hope, our cousin and dearest son.
Hamlet
My lord, 'tis not the sable suit I wear,
No, nor the tears that still stand in my eyes,
Nor the distracted havior in the visage,
Nor all together mixed with outward semblance,
Is equal to the sorrow of my heart.
Him have I lost I must of force forgo;
These but the ornaments and suits of woe.
King
This shows a loving care in you, son Hamlet,
But you must think your father lost a father,
That father dead, lost his, and so shall be until the
General ending. Therefore cease laments.
It is a fault 'gainst heaven, fault 'gainst the dead,
A fault 'gainst nature, and in reason's
Common course most certain,
None lives on earth but he is born to die.
Queen
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
Stay here with us, go not to Wittenberg.
Hamlet
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
King
Spoke like a kind and a most loving son;
And there's no health the King shall drink today
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
The rouse the King shall drink unto Prince Hamlet.
Exeunt all but Hamlet.
Hamlet
Oh, that this too much grieved and sallied flesh
Would melt to nothing, or that the universal
Globe of heaven would turn all to a chaos!
O God, within two months; no not two: married
Mine uncle! Oh, let me not think of it,
My father's brother, but no more like
My father than I to Hercules.
Within two months, ere yet the salt of most
Unrighteous tears had left their flushing
In her gallèd eyes, she married. O God, a beast
Devoid of reason would not have made
Such speed! Frailty, thy name is Woman.
Why, she would hang on him as if increase
Of appetite had grown by what it looked on.
Oh, wicked, wicked speed, to make such
Dexterity to incestuous sheets,
Ere yet the shoes were old,
The which she followed my dead father's corse
Like Niobe, all tears: married. Well, it is not,
Nor it cannot come to good;
But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus [and Barnardo].
Horatio
Health to your lordship!
Hamlet
I am very glad to see you, Horatio, or I much
Forget myself.
Horatio
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Hamlet
O my good friend, I change that name with you.
But what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
[To Marcellus.] Marcellus.
Marcellus
My good lord.
Hamlet
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sirs.
[To Horatio] But what is your affair in Elsinor?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Horatio
A truant disposition, my good lord.
Hamlet
Nor shall you make me truster
Of your own report against yourself.
Sir, I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinor?
Horatio
My good lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Hamlet
Oh, I prithee do not mock me, fellow student,
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Horatio
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Hamlet
Thrift, thrift, Horatio, the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Ere ever I had seen that day, Horatio.
O my father, my father! Methinks I see my father.
Horatio
Where, my lord?
Hamlet
Why, in my mind's eye, Horatio.
Horatio
I saw him once, he was a gallant king.
Hamlet
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.
Horatio
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight,
Hamlet
Saw, who?
Horatio
My lord, the King your father.
Hamlet
Ha, ha, the King my father, kee you?
Horatio
Ceasen your admiration for a while
With an attentive ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This wonder to you.
Hamlet
For God's love, let me hear it.
Horatio
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night.
Been thus encountered by a figure like your father,
Armed to point, exactly cap-à-pie,
Appears before them thrice, he walks
Before their weak and fear-oppressèd eyes
Within his truncheon's length,
While they, distilled almost to jelly
With the act of fear, stands dumb
And speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did.
And I with them the third night kept the watch,
Where as they had delivered form of the thing.
Each part made true and good,
The apparition comes. I knew your father,
These hands are not more like.
Hamlet
'Tis very strange.
Horatio
As I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true,
And we did think it right done
In our duty to let you know it.
Hamlet
Where was this?
Marcellus
My lord, upon the platform where we watched.
Hamlet
Did you not speak to it?
Horatio
My lord, we did, but answer made it none.
Yet once methought it was about to speak,
And lifted up his head to motion,
Like as he would speak, but even then
The morning cock crew loud, and in all haste
It shrunk in haste away, and vanished
Our sight.
Hamlet
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch tonight?
All
We do, my lord.
Hamlet
Armed, say ye?
All
Armed, my good lord.
Hamlet
From top to toe?
All
My good lord, from head to foot.
Hamlet
Why then saw you not his face?
Horatio
Oh, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.
Hamlet
How looked he, frowningly?
Horatio
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Hamlet
Pale, or red?
Horatio
Nay, very pale.
Hamlet
And fixed his eyes upon you?
Horatio
Most constantly.
Hamlet
I would I had been there.
Horatio
It would 'a' much amazed you.
Hamlet
Yea, very like, very like. Stayed it long?
Horatio
While one with moderate pace
Might tell a hundred.
Marcellus
Oh, longer, longer.
Hamlet
His beard was grizzled, no?
Horatio
It was as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver.
Hamlet
I will watch tonight. Perchance 'twill walk again.
Horatio
I warrant it will.
Hamlet
If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, if hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. Gentlemen,
If you have hither concealed this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still,
And whatsoever else shall chance tonight,
Give it an understanding but no tongue.
I will requite your loves. So fare you well.
Upon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve
I'll visit you.
All
Our duties to your honor.
Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
Hamlet
Oh, your loves, your loves, as mine to you.
Farewell.--My father's spirit in arms!
Well, all's not well. I doubt some foul play.
Would the night were come!
Till then, sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
Though all the world o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.
[Scene 3]
Enter Laertes and Ofelia.
Laertes
My necessaries are inbarked. I must aboard,
But, ere I part, mark what I say to thee:
I see Prince Hamlet makes a show of love.
Beware, Ofelia, do not trust his vows.
Perhaps he loves you now, and now his tongue
Speaks from his heart, but yet take heed, my sister.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
Virtue itself scapes not calumnious thoughts.
Believe't, Ofelia. Therefore keep aloof
Lest that he trip thy honor and thy fame.
Ofelia
Brother, to this I have lent attentive ear,
And doubt not but to keep my honor firm.
But, my dear brother, do not you,
Like to a cunning sophister,
Teach me the path and ready way to heaven
While you, forgetting what is said to me,
Yourself like to a careless libertine
Doth give his heart his appetite at full,
And little recks how that his honor dies.
Laertes
No, fear it not, my dear Ofelia.
Here comes my father. Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
Enter Corambis.
Corambis
Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stayed for. There, my blessing with thee,
And these few precepts in thy memory.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar;
Those friends thou hast, and their adoptions tried,
Grapple them to thee with a hoop of steel,
But do not dull the palm with entertain
Of every new unfledged courage.
Beware of entrance into a quarrel, but, being in,
Bear it that the opposèd may beware of thee.
Costly thy apparel as thy purse can buy,
But not expressed in fashion,
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they of France of the chief rank and station
Are of a most select and general chief in that.
This above all, to thy own self be true,
And it must follow as the night the day
Thou canst not then be false to any one.
Farewell. My blessing with thee!
Laertes
I humbly take my leave.--Farewell, Ofelia,
And remember well what I have said to
you.
Exit.
Ofelia
It is already locked within my heart,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Corambis
What is't, Ofelia, he hath said to you?
Ofelia
Something touching the prince Hamlet.
Corambis
Marry, well thought on. 'Tis given me to understand
That you have been too prodigal of your maiden presence
Unto Prince Hamlet. If it be so--
As so 'tis given to me, and that in way of caution--
I must tell you, you do not understand yourself
So well as befits my honor and your credit.
Ofelia
My lord, he hath made many tenders of his loveto me.
Corambis
Tenders? Ay, ay, tenders you may call them.
Ofelia
And withal such earnest vows--
Corambis
Springes to catch woodcocks.
What, do not I know when the blood doth burn
How prodigal the tongue lends the heart vows?
In brief, be more scanter of your maiden presence,
Or, tend'ring thus, you'll tender me a fool.
Ofelia
I shall obey, my lord, in all I may.
Corambis
Ofelia, receive none of his letters,
For lovers' lines are snares to entrap the heart.
"Refuse his tokens. Both of them are keys
To unlock chastity unto desire.
Come in, Ofelia. Such men often prove
"Great in their words, but little in their love.
Ofelia
I will, my lord.
Exeunt.
[Scene 4]
Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.
Hamlet
The air bites shrewd; it is an eager and
A nipping wind. What hour is't?
Horatio
I think it lacks of twelve.
Sound Trumpets.
Marcellus
No, 'tis struck.
Horatio
Indeed, I heard it not. What doth this mean, my lord?
Hamlet
Oh, the King doth wake tonight, and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels,
And as he dreams, his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumphs of his pledge.
Horatio
Is it a custom here?
Hamlet
Ay, marry, is't, and, though I am
Native here and to the manner borne,
It is a custom more honored in the breach
Than in the observance.
Enter the Ghost.
Horatio
Look, my lord, it comes!
Hamlet
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such questionable shape
That I will speak to thee.
I'll call thee Hamlet, king, father, royal Dane.
Oh, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance,
But say why thy canonized bones, hearsèd in death,
Have burst their ceremonies, why thy sepulcher,
In which we saw thee quietly interred,
Hath burst his ponderous and marble jaws
To cast thee up again. What may this mean
That thou, dead corse, again in compleat steel,
Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous, and we fools of nature,
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, speak, wherefore? What may this mean?
Horatio
It beckons you, as though it had something
To impart to you alone.
Marcellus
Look with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removèd ground.
But do not go with it.
Horatio
No, by no means, my lord.
Hamlet
It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
Horatio
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
That beckles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible shape
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And drive you into madness? Think of it.
Hamlet
Still am I called.--Go on, I'll follow thee.
Horatio
My lord, you shall not go.
Hamlet
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee,
And, for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal like itself?--
Go on, I'll follow thee.
Marcellus
My lord, be ruled, you shall not go.
Hamlet
My fate cries out, and makes each petty artery
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen!
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me.
Away, I say!--Go on, I'll follow thee.
[Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]
Horatio
He waxeth desperate with imagination.
Marcellus
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Horatio
Have after. To what issue will this sort?
Marcellus
Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
Exit [with Horatio].
[Scene 5]
Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
Hamlet
I'll go no farther. Whither wilt thou lead me?
Ghost
Mark me.
Hamlet
I will.
Ghost
I am thy father's spirit, doomed for a time
To walk the night, and all the day
Confined in flaming fire,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are purged and burnt away.
Hamlet
Alas, poor ghost!
Ghost
Nay, pity me not, but to my unfolding
Lend thy lis'tning ear. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison house,
I would a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part,
And each particular hair to stand on end
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
But this same blazon must not be, to ears of flesh and blood.
Hamlet, if ever thou didst thy dear father love--
Hamlet
O God!
Ghost
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Hamlet
Murder!
Ghost
Yea, murder in the highest degree,
As in the least 'tis bad,
But mine most foul, beastly, and unnatural.
Hamlet
Haste me to know it, that with wings as swift as
meditation, or the thought of it, may sweep to my revenge.
Ghost
Oh, I find thee apt, and duller shouldst thou be
Than the fat weed which roots itself in ease
On Lethe wharf. Brief let me be.
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is with a forgèd process of my death rankly abused.
But know, thou noble youth: he that did sting
Thy father's heart now wears his crown.
Hamlet
Oh, my prophetic soul, my uncle! My uncle!
Ghost
Yea, he, that incestuous wretch, won to his will with gifts--
Oh, wicked will and gifts that have the power
So to seduce!--my most seeming virtuous Queen.
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel linked,
Would sate itself from a celestial bed
And prey on garbage. But soft, methinks
I scent the mornings air. Brief let me be.
Sleeping within my orchard, my custom always
In the afternoon, upon my secure hour
Thy uncle came, with juice of hebona
In a vial, and through the porches of my ears
Did pour the lep'rous distillment, whose effect
Hold such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it posteth through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And turns the thin and wholesome blood
Like eager droppings into milk,
And all my smooth body, barked and tettered over.
Thus was I sleeping by a brother's hand
Of crown, of queen, of life, of dignity
At once deprived, no reckoning made of,
But sent unto my grave,
With all my accompts and sins upon my head.
Oh, horrible, most horrible!
Hamlet
O God!
Ghost
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
But howsoever, let not thy heart
Conspire against thy mother aught;
Leave her to heaven,
And to the burden that her conscience bears.
I must be gone. The glow-worm shows the martin
To be near, and 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Hamlet, adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.
Exit
Hamlet
O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
And shall I couple hell? Remember thee?
Yes, thou poor ghost. From the tables
Of my memory I'll wipe away all saws of books,
All trivial fond conceits
That ever youth or else observance noted,
And thy remembrance all alone shall sit.
Yes, yes, by heaven, a damned pernicious villain,
Murderous, bawdy, smiling, damnèd villain!
My tables--meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
So uncle, there you are, there you are.
Now to the words: it is "Adieu, adieu! Remember me."
So 'tis enough. I have sworn.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
Horatio
My lord, my lord!
Marcellus
Lord Hamlet!
Horatio
Ill, lo, lo, ho, ho!
Marcellus
Ill, lo, lo, so, ho, so, come boy, come!
Horatio
Heavens secure him!
Marcellus
How is't, my noble lord?
Horatio
What news, my lord?
Hamlet
Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
Horatio
Good my lord, tell it.
Hamlet
No not I, you'll reveal it.
Horatio
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Marcellus
Nor I, my lord.
Hamlet
How say you then? Would heart of man
Once think it? But you'll be secret.
Both
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Hamlet
There's never a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.
Horatio
There need no ghost come from the grave to tell you this.
Hamlet
Right, you are in the right, and therefore
I hold it meet without more circumstance at all,
We shake hands and part; you as your business
And desires shall lead you--for look you,
Every man hath business and desires, such
As it is--and for my own poor part, I'll go pray.
Horatio
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Hamlet
I am sorry they offend you; heartily, yes, faith, heartily.
Horatio
There's no offense, my lord.
Hamlet
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offense too. Touching this vision,
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
For your desires to know what is between us,
O'ermaster it as you may.
And now, kind friends, as you are friends,
Scholars and gentlemen,
Grant me one poor request.
Both
What is't, my lord?
Hamlet
Never make known what you have seen tonight
Both
My lord, we will not.
Hamlet
Nay, but swear.
Horatio
In faith, my lord, not I.
Marcellus
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Hamlet
Nay, upon my sword, indeed upon my sword.
Ghost
Swear.
The Ghost under the stage.
Hamlet
Ha, ha, come you here, this fellow in the cellerage,
Here consent to swear.
Horatio
Propose the oath, my lord.
Hamlet
Never to speak what you have seen tonight,
Swear by my sword.
Ghost
Swear.
Hamlet
Hic et ubique? Nay then, we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen, and lay your hands
Again upon this sword, never to speak
Of that which you have seen, swear by my sword.
Ghost
Swear.
Hamlet
Well said, old mole. Canst work in the earth?
So fast, a worthy pioneer. Once more remove.
Horatio
Day and night, but this is wondrous strange.
Hamlet
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in the heaven and earth, Horatio,
Then are dreamt of in your philosophy.
But come here, as before, you never shall--
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on--
That you at such times seeing me never shall
With arms encumb'red thus, or this headshake,
Or by pronouncing some undoubtful phrase,
As "Well, well, we know," or "We could an if we would,"
Or "There be, an if they might," or such ambiguous
Giving out, to note that you know aught of me:
This not to do, so grace and mercy
At your most need help you, swear.
Ghost
Swear.
Hamlet
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen,
In all my love I do commend me to you,
And what so poor a man as Hamlet may
To pleasure you, God willing shall not want.
Nay, come, let's go together.
But still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint. Oh, cursed spite,
That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together.
Exeunt.
[Scene 6]
Enter Corambis and Montano.
Corambis
Montano, here, these letters to my son,
And this same money with my blessing to him,
And bid him ply his learning, good Montano.
Montano
I will, my lord.
Corambis
You shall do very well, Montano, to say thus:
"I knew the gentleman," or "know his father,"
To inquire the manner of his life,
As thus; being amongst his acquaintance,
You may say, you saw him at such a time, mark you me,
At game, or drinking, swearing, or drabbing,
You may go so far.
Montano
My lord, that will impeach his reputation.
Corambis
I'faith, not a whit, no, not a whit.
Now happily he closeth with you in the consequence,
As you may bridle it, not disparage him a jot.
What was I about to say?
Montano
He closeth with him in the consequence.
Corambis
Ay, you say right, he closeth with him thus,
This will he say--let me see what he will say--
Marry, this: "I saw him yesterday," or "t'other day,"
Or "then," or "at such time," "a-dicing,"
Or "at tennis," ay, or "drinking drunk," or "ent'ring
Of a house of lightness," viz. brothel.
Thus, sir, do we that know the world, being men of reach,
By indirections find directions forth,
And so shall you my son. You ha' me, ha' you not?
Montano
I have, my lord.
Corambis
Well, fare you well. Commend me to him.
Montano
I will, my lord.
Corambis
And bid him ply his music.
Montano
My lord, I will.
Exit.
Enter Ofelia.
Corambis
Farewell.--How now, Ofelia, what's the news with you?
Ofelia
O my dear father, such a change in nature,
So great an alteration in a prince,
So pitiful to him, fearful to me,
A maiden's eye ne'er lookèd on!
Corambis
Why, what's the matter, my Ofelia?
Ofelia
Oh, young Prince Hamlet, the only flower of Denmark,
He is bereft of all the wealth he had!
The jewel that adorned his feature most
Is filched and stol'n away: his wit's bereft him.
He found me walking in the gallery all alone.
There comes he to me, with a distracted look,
His garters lagging down, his shoes untied,
And fixed his eyes so steadfast on my face
As if they had vowed this is their latest object.
Small while he stood, but grips me by the wrist,
And there he holds my pulse till, with a sigh,
He doth unclasp his hold and parts away
Silent as is the mid time of the night.
And as he went, his eye was still on me,
For thus his head over his shoulder looked.
He seemed to find the way without his eyes,
For out of doors he went without their help,
And so did leave me.
Corambis
Mad for thy love.
What, have you given him any cross words of late?
Ofelia
I did repel his letters, deny his gifts,
As you did charge me.
Corambis
Why, that hath made him mad.
By heav'n, 'tis as proper for our age to cast
Beyond ourselves as 'tis for the younger sort
To leave their wantonness. Well, I am sorry
That I was so rash. But what remedy?
Let's to the King. This madness may prove,
Though wild awhile, yet more true to thy love.
Exeunt
[Scene 7]
Enter King and Queen, Rossencraft and Gilderstone.
King
Right noble friends, that our dear cousin Hamlet
Hath lost the very heart of all his sense,
It is most right, and we most sorry for him.
Therefore we do desire, even as you tender
Our care to him and our great love to you,
That you will labor but to wring from him
The cause and ground of his distemperancy.
Do this, the King of Denmark shall be thankful.
Rossencraft
My lord, whatsoever lies within our power
Your majesty may more command in words
Than use persuasions to your liege men, bound
By love, by duty, and obedience.
Gilderstone
What we may do for both your majesties
To know the grief troubles the prince your son,
We will endeavor all the best we may;
So in all duty do we take our leave.
King
Thanks, Gilderstone, and gentle Rossencraft.
Queen
Thanks, Rossencraft, and gentle Gilderstone.
Enter Corambis and Ofelia.
Corambis
My lord, the ambassadors are joyfully
Returned from Norway.
King
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Corambis
Have I, my lord? I assure your grace,
I hold my duty as I hold my life,
Both to my God and to my sovereign King;
And I believe, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the train of policy so well
As it had wont to do, but I have found
The very depth of Hamlet's lunacy.
Queen
[To the King] God grant he hath!
Enter the Ambassadors [Voltemar and Cornelia, with a diplomatic dispatch].
King
Now, Voltemar, what from our brother Norway?
Voltemar
Most fair returns of greetings and desires.
Upon our first he sent forth to suppress
His nephew's levies, which to him appeared
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
But, better looked into, he truly found
It was against your highness, whereat grieved
That so his sickness, age, and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortenbrasse, which he in brief obeys,
Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your majesty;
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack,
With an entreaty herein further shown
That it would please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for that enterprise
On such regards of safety and allowances
As therein are set down.
[The King is handed a document.]
King
It likes us well, and at fit time and leisure
We'll read and answer these his articles.
Meantime, we thank you for your well
Took labor. Go to your rest. At night we'll feast together.
Right welcome home.
Exeunt Ambassadors.
Corambis
This business is very well dispatched.
Now, my lord, touching the young Prince Hamlet,
Certain it is that he is mad. Mad let us grant him, then.
Now to know the cause of this effect,
Or else to say the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause--
Queen
Good my lord, be brief.
Corambis
Madam I will. My lord, I have a daughter,
Have while she's mine; for that we think
Is surest we often lose. Now to the prince.
My lord, but note this letter,
The which my daughter in obedience
Delivered to my hands.
King
Read it, my lord.
Corambis
Mark, my lord.
[He reads the letter.]
"Doubt that in earth is fire,
Doubt that the stars do move,
Doubt truth to be a liar,
But do not doubt I love.
To the beautiful Ofelia.
Thine ever, the most unhappy Prince Hamlet."
My lord, what do you think of me?
Ay, or what might you think when I saw this?
King
As of a true friend and a most loving subject.
Corambis
I would be glad to prove so.
Now when I saw this letter, thus I bespake my maiden:
"Lord Hamlet is a prince out of your star,
And one that is unequal for your love."
Therefore I did command her refuse his letters,
Deny his tokens, and to absent herself.
She as my child obediently obeyed me.
Now, since which time, seeing his love thus crossed,
Which I took to be idle and but sport,
He straightway grew into a melancholy,
From that unto a fast, then unto distraction,
Then into a sadness, from that unto a madness,
And so, by continuance and weakness of the brain,
Into this frenzy which now possesseth him.
And if this be not true, take this from this.
King
[To the Queen] Think you 'tis so?
Corambis
How? So, my lord, I would very fain know
That thing that I have said 'tis so, positively,
And it hath fallen out otherwise.
Nay, if circumstances lead me on,
I'll find it out if it were hid
As deep as the center of the earth.
King
How should we try this same?
Corambis
Marry, my good lord, thus:
The Prince's walk is here in the gallery;
There let Ofelia walk until he comes.
Yourself and I will stand close in the study.
There shall you hear the effect of all his heart,
And if it prove any otherwise than love,
Then let my censure fail another time.
King
See where he comes, poring upon a book.
Enter Hamlet.
Corambis
Madam, will it please your grace
To leave us here?
Queen
With all my heart.
Exit.
Corambis
And here Ofelia, read you on this book,
And walk aloof; the King shall be unseen.
[The King and Corambis conceal themselves.]
Hamlet
To be, or not to be, ay, there's the point,
To die, to sleep, is that all? Ay, all.
No, to sleep, to dream, ay, marry, there it goes,
For in that dream of death, when we awake,
And borne before an everlasting judge,
From whence no passenger ever returned,
The undiscovered country, at whose sight
The happy smile, and the accursèd damned.
But for this, the joyful hope of this,
Who'd bear the scorns and flattery of the world,
Scorned by the right rich, the rich cursed of the poor,
The widow being oppressed, the orphan wronged,
The taste of hunger, or a tyrant's reign,
And thousand more calamities besides,
To grunt and sweat under this weary life,
When that he may his full quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would this endure,
But for a hope of something after death?
Which puzzles the brain, and doth confound the sense,
Which makes us rather bear those evils we have
Than fly to others that we know not of.
Ay, that. Oh, this conscience makes cowards of us all.--
Lady, in thy orisons be all my sins remembered.
Ofelia
My lord, I have sought opportunity, which now I have, to redeliver to your worthy hands a small remembrance, such tokens which I have received of you.
Hamlet
Are you fair?
Ofelia
My lord?
Hamlet
Are you honest?
Ofelia
What means my lord?
Hamlet
That if you be fair and honest, your beauty should admit no discourse to your honesty.
Ofelia
My lord, can beauty have better privilege than with honesty?
Hamlet
Yea, marry, may it; for beauty may [sooner] transform
Honesty from what she was into a bawd
Than honesty can transform beauty.
This was sometimes a paradox,
But now the time gives it scope.
I never gave you nothing.
Ofelia
My lord, you know right will you did,
And with them such earnest vows of love
As would have moved the stoniest breast alive.
But now too true I find:
Rich gifts wax poor when givers grow unkind.
Hamlet
I never loved you.
Ofelia
You made me believe you did.
Hamlet
Oh, thou shouldst not ha' believed me!
Go to a nunnery, go. Why shouldst thou
Be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,
But I could accuse myself of such crimes
s It had been better my mother had ne'er borne me.
Oh, I am very proud, ambitious, disdainful,
With more sins at my beck than I have thoughts
To put them in. What should such fellows as I
Do, crawling between heaven and earth?
To a nunnery, go. We are arrant knaves all.
Believe none of us. To a nunnery, go.
Ofelia
Oh, heavens secure him!
Hamlet
Where's thy father?
Ofelia
At home, my lord.
Hamlet
For God's sake, let the doors be shut on him,
He may play the fool nowhere but in his
Own house. To a nunnery, go.
Ofelia
Help him, good God!
Hamlet
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee
This plague to thy dowry:
Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,
Thou shalt not scape calumny. To a nunnery, go.
Ofelia
Alas, what change is this?
Hamlet
But if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool,
For wise men know well enough
What monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go.
Ofelia
Pray God restore him!
Hamlet
Nay, I have heard of your paintings, too.
God hath given you one face
And you make yourselves another.
You fig, and you amble, and you nickname God's creatures,
Making your wantonness your ignorance.
A pox, 'tis scurvy. I'll no more of it.
It hath made me mad. I'll no more marriages.
All that are married, but one, shall live;
The rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.
To a nunnery, go!
Exit.
Ofelia
Great God of heaven, what a quick change is this?
The courtier, scholar, soldier, all in him,
All dashed and splintered thence. Oh, woe is me,
To ha' seen what I have seen, see what I see!
Exit.
Enter King and Corambis [coming forward from concealment].
King
Love? No, no, that's not the cause.
Some deeper thing it is that troubles him.
Corambis
Well, something it is. My lord, content you awhile.
I will myself go feel him. Let me work.
I'll try him every way. See where he comes.
Send you those gentlemen. Let me alone
To find the depth of this. Away, be gone!
Exit King.
Enter Hamlet.
Now, my good lord, do you know me?
Hamlet
Yea, very well, y'are a fishmonger.
Corambis
Not I, my lord.
Hamlet
Then, sir, I would you were so honest a man.
For to be honest, as this age goes,
is one man to be picked out of ten thousand.
Corambis
What do you read, my lord?
Hamlet
Words, words.
Corambis
What's the matter, my lord?
Hamlet
Between who?
Corambis
I mean the matter you read, my lord.
Hamlet
Marry, most vile heresy:
For here the satirical satyr writes
That old men have hollow eyes, weak backs,
Grey beards, pitiful weak hams, gouty legs,
All which, sir, I most potently believe not.
For, sir, yourself shall be old as I am,
If, like a crab, you could go backward.
Corambis
[Aside] How pregnant his replies are, and full of wit!
Yet at first he took me for a fishmonger.
All this comes by love, the vehemency of love;
And when I was young, I was very idle,
And suffered much ecstasy in love, very near this.--
Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
Hamlet
Into my grave.
Corambis
By the mass, that's out of the air, indeed,
Very shrewd answers.--
My lord, I will take my leave of you.
Enter Gilderstone and Rossencraft.
Hamlet
You can take nothing from me, sir,
I will more willingly part withal.--
Old doting fool!
Corambis
[To Gilderstone and Rossencraft] You seek Prince Hamlet. See, there he is.
Exit.
Gilderstone
Health to your lordship!
Hamlet
What, Gilderstone, and Rossencraft!
Welcome, kind schoolfellows, to Elsinore.
Gilderstone
We thank your grace, and would be very glad
You were as when we were at Wittenberg.
Hamlet
I thank you, but is this vistitation free of
Yourselves, or were you not sent for?
Tell me true, come. I know the good King and Queen
Sent for you. There is a kind of confession in your eye.
Come, I know you were sent for.
Gilderstone
[Aside to Rossencraft.] What say you?
Hamlet
[Aside] Nay, then, I see how the wind sits.
[To them] Come, you were sent for.
Rossencraft
My lord, we were, and willingly, if we might,
Know the cause and ground of your discontent.
Hamlet
Why, I want preferment.
Rossencraft
I think not so, my lord.
Hamlet
Yes, faith, this great world you see contents me not,
No, nor the spangled heavens, nor earth, nor sea;
No, nor man, that is so glorious a creature,
Contents not me--no, nor woman too, though you laugh.
Gilderstone
My lord, we laugh not at that.
Hamlet
Why did you laugh, then,
When I said, man did not content me?
Gilderstone
My lord, we laughed, when you said man did not content you.
What entertainment the players shall have?
We boarded them o'the way. They are coming to you.
Hamlet
Players? What players be they?
Rossencraft
My lord, the tragedians of the city,
Those that you took delight to see so often.
Hamlet
How comes it that they travel? Do they grow resty?
Gilderstone
No, my lord, their reputation holds as it was wont.
Hamlet
How then?
Gilderstone
I'faith, my lord, novelty carries it away.
For the principal public audience that
Came to them are turned to private plays,
And to the humor of children.
Hamlet
I do not greatly wonder of it,
For those that would make mops and mows
At my uncle when my father lived
Now give a hundred, two hundred pounds
For his picture. But they shall be welcome.
He that plays the King shall have tribute of me,
The vent'rous Knight shall use his foil and target,
The Lover shall sigh gratis,
The Clown shall make them laugh
That are tickled in the lungs, or the blank verse shall halt for't,
And the Lady shall have leave to speak her mind freely.
The Trumpets sound.
Enter Corambis.
Do you see yonder great baby?
He is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.
Gilderstone
That may be, for they say an old man
Is twice a child.
Hamlet
I'll prophesy to you he comes to tell me o'the players.--
You say true, o'Monday last, 'twas so indeed.
Corambis
My lord, I have news to tell you.
Hamlet
My lord, I have news to tell you:
When Roscius was an actor in Rome--
Corambis
The actors are come hither, my lord.
Hamlet
Buzz, buzz.
Corambis
The best actors in Christendom,
Either for comedy, tragedy, history, pastoral,
Pastoral-historical, historical-comical,
Comical-historical-pastoral, tragedy-historical:
Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plato too light;
For the law hath writ those are the only men.
Hamlet
O Jephthah, judge of Israel! What a treasure hadst thou?
Corambis
Why, what a treasure had he, my lord?
Hamlet
Why one fair daughter, and no more,
The which he lovèd passing well.
Corambis
[Aside] Ah, still harping o'my daughter!'--Well, my lord,
If you call me Iephthah, I have a daughter that
I love passing well.
Hamlet
Nay that follows not.
Corambis
What follows, then, my lord?
Hamlet
Why, by lot, or God wot, or as it came to pass,
And so it was, the first verse of the godly ballad
Will tell you all. For look you where my abridgement comes.
Enter Players.
Welcome masters! Welcome all.--
What, my old friend, thy face is valanced
Since I saw thee last. Com'st thou to beard me in Denmark?--
My young lady and mistress! By'r Lady, but your
Ladyship is grown by the altitude of a chopine higher than you were.
Pray God, sir, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent
Gold, be not cracked in the ring.-- Come on, masters,
We'll even to't, like French falconers,
Fly at any thing we see. Come, a taste of your
Quality, a speech, a passionate speech.
Players
What speech, my good lord?
Hamlet
I heard thee speak a speech once,
but it was never acted, or, if it were,
Never above twice, for, as I remember,
It pleased not the vulgar; it was caviary
To the million. But to me
And others that received it in the like kind,
Cried in the top of their judgments, an excellent play,
Set down with as great modesty as cunning.
One said there was no sallets in the lines to make them savory,
But called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet.
Come, a speech in it I chiefly remember
was Aeneas' tale to Dido,
And then especially where he talks of princes' slaughter.
If it live in thy memory, begin at this line--
Let me see'--
The rugged Pyrrhus, like th'Hycarnian beast'--
No, 'tis not so. It begins with Pyrrhus:
Oh, I have it.
The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couchèd in the ominous horse,
Hath now his black and grim complexion smeared
With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
Now is he total guise, horridly tricked
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons.
Baked and imparchèd in calagulate gore,
Rifted in earth and fire, old grandsire Pram seeks.
So, go on.
Corambis
Afore God, my lord, well spoke, and with good accent.
Player
Anon he finds him striking too short at Greeks.
His antic sword, rebellious to his arm,
Lies where it falls, unable to resist.
Pyrrus at Priam drives, but, all in rage,
Strikes wide; but with the whiff and wind
Of his fell sword, th'unnervèd father falls.
Corambis
Enough, my friend. 'tis too long.
Hamlet
It shall to the barber's with your beard.
[To the First Player] A pox! He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry,
Or else he sleeps. Come on to Hecuba, come.
Player
But who, oh, who had seen the moblèd queen--
Corambis
Moblèd queen is good, 'faith, very good.
Player
All in the alarum and fear of death rose up,
And o'er her weak and all o'er-teeming loins a blanket
And a kercher on that head where late the diadem stood,
Who this had seen, with tongue-envenomed speech
Would treason have pronounced,
For if the gods themselves had seen her then,
When she saw Pyrrhus with malicious strokes
Mincing her husband's limbs,
It would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
And passion in the gods.
Corambis
Look, my Lord, if he hath not changed his color,
and hath tears in his eyes.--No more, good heart, no more!
Hamlet
'Tis well, 'tis very well. [To Corambis] I pray, my lord,
Will you see the players well bestowed?
I tell you, they are the chronicles
And brief abstracts of the time.
After your death, I can tell you,
You were better have a bad epitaph
Than their ill report while you live.
Corambis
My lord, I will use them according to their deserts.
Hamlet
Oh, far better, man. Use every man after his deserts,
Then who should scape whipping?
Use them after your own honor and dignity.
The less they deserve, the greater credit's yours.
Corambis
[To the Players] Welcome, my good fellows.
Exit.
Hamlet
[As the Players are about to follow Corambis] Come hither, masters. Can you not play "The Murder of Gonzago"?
Players
Yes, my lord.
Hamlet
And couldst not thou for a need study me
Some dozen or sixteen lines,
Which I would set down and insert?
Players
Yes, very easily, my good lord.
Hamlet
'Tis well. I thank you. Follow that lord.
And, do you hear, sirs? Take heed you mock him not.
[To Gilderstone and Rossencraft] Gentlemen, for your kindness I thank you,
And for a time I would desire you leave me.
Gilderstone
Our love and duty is at your command.
Exeunt all but Hamlet.
Hamlet
Why, what a dunghill idiot slave am I!
Why, these players here draw water from eyes:
For Hecuba. Why, what is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?
What would he do an if he had my loss?
His father murdered, and a crown bereft him?
He would turn all his tears to drops of blood,
Amaze the standers-by with his laments,
Strike more than wonder in the judicial ears,
Confound the ignorant, and make mute the wise.
Indeed, his passion would be general.
Yet I, like to an ass and John-a-Dreams,
Having my father murdered by a villain,
Stand still, and let it pass. Why, sure I am a coward.
Who plucks me by the beard, or twits my nose,
Gives me the lie i'th' throat down to the lungs?
Sure I should take it, or else I have no gall,
Or by this I should ha' fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal, this damned villain,
Treacherous, bawdy, murderous villain!
Why, this is brave, that I, the son of my dear father,
Should like a scallion, like a very drab,
Thus rail in words. About, my brain!
I have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play
Hath, by the very cunning of the scene, confessed a murder
Committed long before.
This spirit that I have seen may be the devil,
And out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such men,
Doth seek to damn me. I will have sounder proofs.
The play's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.
Exit.
[Scene 8]
Enter the King, Queen, and Lords [Corambis, Rossencraft, and Gilderstone].
King
Lords, can you by no means find
The cause of our son Hamlet's lunacy?
You being so near in love, even from his youth,
Methinks should gain more than a stranger should.
Gilderstone
My lord, we have done all the best we could
To wring from him the cause of all his grief,
But still he puts us off, and by no means
Would make an answer to that we exposed.
Rossencraft
Yet was he something more inclined to mirth
Before we left him, and, I take it,
He hath given order for a play tonight,
At which he craves your highness' company.
King
With all our heart; it likes us very well.
Gentlemen, seek still to increase his mirth.
Spare for no cost, our coffers shall be open,
And we unto yourselves will still be thankful.
Both
In all we can, be sure you shall command.
Queen
Thanks, gentlemen, and what the Queen of Denmark
May pleasure you, be sure you shall not want.
Gilderstone
We'll once again unto the noble prince.
King
Thanks to you both.
[Exeunt Rossencraft and Gilderstone.]
Gertred, you'll see this play?
Queen
My lord, I will, and it joys me at the soul
He is inclined to any kind of mirth.
Corambis
Madam, I pray be ruled by me,
And, my good sovereign, give me leave to speak.
We cannot yet find out the very ground
Of his distemperance. Therefore
I hold it meet, if so it please you,
Else they shall not meet, and thus it is--
King
What is't, Corambis?
Corambis
Marry, my good lord, this: soon, when the sports are done,
Madam, send you in haste to speak with him,
And I myself will stand behind the arras.
There question you the cause of all his grief,
And then, in love and nature unto you, he'll tell you all.
My lord, how think you on't?
King
It likes us well. Gertred, what say you?
Queen
With all my heart. Soon will I send for him.
Corambis
Myself will be that happy messenger,
Who hopes his grief will be revealed to her.
Exeunt omnes.
[Scene 9]
Enter Hamlet and the Players.
Hamlet
Pronounce me this speech trippingly o'the tongue as I taught thee.
Marry, an you mouth it, as a many of your players do,
I'd rather hear a town bull bellow
Than such a fellow speak my lines.
Nor do not saw the air thus with your hands,
But give everything his action with temperance.
Oh, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig fellow
To tear a passion in totters, into very rags,
To split the ears of the ignorant, who for the
Most part are capable of nothing but dumb shows and noises.
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant.
It out-Herods Herod.
Players
My lord, we have indifferently reformed that among us.
Hamlet
The better, the better. Mend it altogether.
There be fellows that I have seen play,
And heard others commend them, and that highly too,
That, having neither the gait of Christian, pagan,
Nor Turk, have so strutted and bellowed
That you would ha' thought some of Nature's journeymen
Had made men, and not made them well,
They imitated humanity so abhominable.
Take heed, avoid it.
Players
I warrant you, my lord.
Hamlet
And do you hear? Let not your Clown speak
More than is set down. There be of them, I can tell you,
That will laugh themselves, to set on some
Quantity of barren spectators to laugh with them,
Albeit there is some necessary point in the play
Then to be observed. Oh, 'tis vile, and shows
A pitiful ambition in the fool that useth it.
And then you have some again that keeps one suit
Of jests, as a man is known by one suit of
Apparel, and gentlemen quotes his jests down
In their tables before they come to the play, as thus:
"Cannot you stay till I eat my porridge?" and "You owe me
A quarter's wages," and "My coat wants a cullison,"
And "Your beer is sour," and blabbering with his lips
And thus keeping in his cinquepace of jests
When, God knows, the warm Clown cannot make a jest
Unless by chance, as the blind man catcheth a hare.
Masters, tell him of it.
Players
We will, my lord.
Hamlet
Well, go make you ready.
Exeunt Players.
[Horatio!]
[Enter Horatio.]
Horatio
Here, my lord.
Hamlet
Horatio, thou art even as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.
Horatio
Oh, my lord!
Hamlet
Nay, why should I flatter thee?
Why should the poor be flattered?
What gain should I receive by flattering thee,
That nothing hath but thy good mind?
Let flattery sit on those time-pleasing tongues
To gloze with them that loves to hear their praise,
And not with such as thou, Horatio.
There is a play tonight, wherein one scene they have
Comes very near the murder of my father.
When thou shalt see that act afoot,
Mark thou the King; do but observe his looks,
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face.
And if he do not bleach and change at that,
It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen.
Horatio, have a care; observe him well.
Horatio
My lord, mine eyes shall still be on his face,
And not the smallest alteration
That shall appear in him but I shall note it.
Hamlet
Hark, they come.
Enter King, Queen, Corambis, [Ofelia,] and other Lords [Rossencraft and Gilderstone].
King
How now, son Hamlet, how fare you? Shall we have a play?
Hamlet
I'faith, the chameleon's dish, not capon-crammed-- feed o'the air.
Ay, father! [To Corambis] My lord, you played in the university.
Corambis
That I did, my lord, and I was counted a good actor.
Hamlet
What did you enact there?
Corambis
My lord, I did act Julius Caesar. I was killed in the Capitol. Brutus killed me.
Hamlet
It was a brute part of him
To kill so capital a calf.
Come, be these players ready?
Queen
Hamlet, come sit down by me.
Hamlet
No, by my faith, mother, here's a mettle more attractive.
[To Ofelia.] Lady, will you give me leave, and so forth,
To lay my head in your lap?
Ofelia
No, my lord.
Hamlet
Upon your lap. What, do you think I meant contrary matters?
Enter, in a dumb-show, the King and the Queen. He sits down in an arbor. She leaves him. Then enters Lucianus with poison in a vial, and pours it in his ears, and goes away. Then the Queen cometh and finds him dead, and goes away with the other.
[Exeunt Players.]
Ofelia
What means this, my lord?
Enter the Prologue.
Hamlet
This is miching Mallico. That means mischief.
Ofelia
What doth this mean, my lord?
Hamlet
You shall hear anon. This fellow will tell you all.
Ofelia
Will he tell us what this show means?
Hamlet
Ay, or any show you'll show him.
Be not afeard to show, he'll not be afeard to tell.
Oh, these players cannot keep counsel. They'll tell all.
Prologue
For us, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.
[Exit.]
Hamlet
Is't a prologue, or a poesie for a ring?
Ofelia
'Tis short, my lord.
Hamlet
As women's love.
Enter the Duke and Duchess.
Duke
Full forty years are past--their date is gone--
Since happy time joined both our hearts as one.
And now the blood that filled my youthful veins
Runs weakly in their pipes, and all the strains
Of music, which whilom pleased mine ear,
Is now a burden that age cannot bear.
And therefore sweet Nature must pay his due.
To heaven must I, and leave the earth with you.
Duchess
Oh, say not so, lest that you kill my heart!
When death takes you, let life from me depart!
Duke
Content thyself. When ended is my date,
Thou mayst perchance have a more noble mate,
More wise, more youthful, and one--
Duchess
Oh, speak no more, for then I am accurst!
None weds the second but she kills the first.
A second time I kill my lord that's dead
When second husband kisses me in bed.
Hamlet
Oh, wormwood, wormwood!
Duke
I do believe you, sweet, what now you speak,
But what we do determine oft we break,
For our demises still are overthrown;
Our thought are ours, their end's none of our own.
So think you will no second husband wed,
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
Duchess
Both here and there pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
Hamlet
If she should break now!
Duke
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious time with sleep.
Duchess
Sleep rock thy brain,
And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit Lady.
Hamlet
Madam, how do you like this play?
Queen
The lady protests too much.
Hamlet
Oh, but she'll keep her word.
King
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offense in it?
Hamlet
No offense in the world. Poison in jest, poison in jest.
King
What do you call the name of the play?
Hamlet
Mousetrap. Marry, how? Trapically. This play is
The image of a murder done in Guiana. Albertus
Was the duke's name, his wife Baptista.
Father, it is a knavish piece o'work, but what
O' that? It toucheth not us, you and I that have free
Souls. Let the galled jade wince. This is one
[Enter Lucianus.]
Lucianus, nephew to the King.
Ofelia
Y'are as good as a chorus, my lord.
Hamlet
I could interpret the love you bear, if I saw the poopies dallying.
Ofelia
Y'are very pleasant, my lord.
Hamlet
Who, I? Your only jig-maker. Why, what should a man do but be merry? For look how cheerfully my mother looks; my father died within these two hours.
Ofelia
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
Hamlet
Two months? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,
For I'll have a suit of sables. Jesus, two months dead,
And not forgotten yet? Nay, then, there's some
Likelihood a gentleman's death may outlive memory.
But, by my faith, he must build churches, then,
Or else he must follow the old epitithe:
"With ho, with ho, the hobby-horse is forgot."
Ofelia
Your jests are keen, my lord.
Hamlet
It would cost you a groaning to take them off.
Ofelia
Still better and worse.
Hamlet
So you must take your husband, begin. Murdered!
Begin. A pox, leave thy damnable faces and begin.
Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.
Murderer
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing,
Confederate season, else no creature seeing,
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate's bane thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property
One wholesome life usurps immediately.
[He pours the poison in the sleeper's ears.]
Exit.
Hamlet
He poisons him for his estate.
King
Lights! I will to bed.
Corambis
The King rises. Lights, ho!
Exeunt King and Lords.
Hamlet
What, frighted with false fires?
Then let the stricken deer go weep,
The heart ungallèd play,
For some must laugh, while some must weep;
Thus runs the world away.
Horatio
The King is moved, my lord.
Hamlet
Ay, Horatio, I'll take the Ghost's word
for more than all the coin in Denmark.
Enter Rossencraft and Gilderstone.
Rossencraft
Now, my lord, how is't with you?
Hamlet
An if the King like not the tragedy,
Why, then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
Rossencraft
We are very glad to see your grace so pleasant.
My good lord, let us again entreat
To know of you the ground and cause of your distemperature.
Gilderstone
My lord, your mother craves to speak with you.
Hamlet
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
Rossencraft
But, my good lord, shall I entreat thus much?
Hamlet
[Offering Rossencraft a recorder] I pray, will you play upon this pipe?
Rossencraft
Alas, my lord, I cannot.
Hamlet
[To Gilderstone] Pray, will you?
Gilderstone
I have no skill, my lord.
Hamlet
Why look, it is a thing of nothing.
'Tis but stopping of these holes,
And with a little breath from your lips
it will give most delicate music.
Gilderstone
But this cannot we do, my lord.
Hamlet
Pray now, pray, heartily, I beseech you.
Rossencraft
My lord, we cannot.
Hamlet
Why, how unworthy a thing would you make of me!
You would seem to know my stops, you would play upon me,
You would search the very inward part of my heart
And dive into the secret of my soul.
Zounds, do you think I am easier to be played
On than a pipe? Call me what instrument
You will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot
Play upon me. Besides, to be demanded by a sponge--
Rossencraft
How, a sponge, my lord?
Hamlet
Ay, sir, a sponge, that soaks up the King's
Countenance, favors, and rewards, that makes
His liberality your storehouse. But such as you
Do the King, in the end, best service;
For he doth keep you as an ape doth nuts,
In the corner of his jaw: first mouths you,
Then swallows you. So, when he hath need
Of you, 'tis but squeezing of you,
And, sponge, you shall be dry again, you shall.
Rossencraft
Well, my lord, we'll take our leave.
Hamlet
Farewell, farewell. God bless you.
Exit Rossencraft and Gilderstone.
Enter Corambis
Corambis
My lord, the Queen would speak with you.
Hamlet
Do you see yonder cloud in the shape of a camel?
Corambis
'Tis like a camel, indeed.
Hamlet
Now me thinks it's like a weasel.
Corambis
'Tis backed like a weasel.
Hamlet
Or like a whale.
Corambis
Very like a whale.
Exit Corambis.
Hamlet
Why then, tell my mother I'll come by and by.
Good night, Horatio.
Horatio
Good night unto your lordship.
Exit Horatio.
Hamlet
My mother! She hath sent to speak with me.
O God, let ne'er the heart of Nero enter
This soft bosom.
Let me be cruel, not unnatural.
I will speak daggers. Those sharp words being spent,
To do her wrong my soul shall ne'er consent.
Exit.
[Scene 10]
Enter the King.
King
Oh, that this wet that falls upon my face
Would wash the crime clear from my conscience!
When I look up to heaven, I see my trespass;
The earth doth still cry out upon my fact.
Pay me the murder of a brother and a king,
And the adulterous fault I have committed:
Oh, these are sins that are unpardonable!
Why, say thy sins were blacker than is jet,
Yet may contrition make them as white as snow.
Ay, but still to persever in a sin,
It is an act 'gainst the universal power.
Most wretched man, stoop, bend thee to thy prayer,
Ask grace of heaven to keep thee from despair.
He kneels.
Enters Hamlet.
Hamlet
[Drawing his sword.] Ay so. Come forth and work thy last.
And thus he dies; and so am I revenged.
No, not so. He took my father sleeping, his sins brim full.
And how his soul stood to the state of heaven,
Who knows, save the immortal powers?
And shall I kill him now,
When he is purging of his soul,
Making his way for heaven? This is a benefit,
And not revenge. No, get thee up again.
[He sheathes his sword.]
When he's at game, swearing, taking his carouse, drinking drunk,
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed,
Or at some act that hath no relish
Of salvation in't, then trip him,
That his heels may kick at heaven
And fall as low as hell. My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy weary days.
Exit Hamlet.
King
My words fly up, my sins remain below.
No King on earth is safe, if God's his foe.
Exit King.
[Scene 11]
Enter Queen and Corambis.
Corambis
Madam, I hear young Hamlet coming.
I'll shroud myself behind the arras.
Exit Cor[ambis].
Queen
Do so, my lord.
Hamlet
[Offstage] Mother, mother!
[Enter Hamlet]
Oh, are you here?
How is't with you, mother?
Queen
How is't with you?
Hamlet
I'll tell you, but first we'll make all safe.
Queen
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Hamlet
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Queen
How now, boy?
Hamlet
How now, mother! Come here, sit down, for you shall hear me speak.
Queen
What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, ho!
Corambis
[Behind the arras] Help for the Queen!
Hamlet
Ay, a rat! Dead, for a ducat!
[He stabs through the arras. Corambis falls, and is discovered, slain.]
Rash intruding fool, farewell.
I took thee for thy better.
Queen
Hamlet, what hast thou done?
Hamlet
Not so much harm, good mother,
As to kill a king and marry with his brother.
Queen
How! Kill a king!
Hamlet
Ay, a king. Nay, sit you down, and, ere you part,
If you be made of penetrable stuff,
I'll make your eyes look down into your heart
And see how horrid there and black it shows.
Queen
Hamlet, what mean'st thou by these killing words?
Hamlet
Why, this I mean.
[Showing her two likenesses]
See here, behold this picture.
It is the portraiture of your deceasèd husband.
See here a face to outface Mars himself,
An eye at which his foes did tremble at,
A front wherein all virtues are set down
For to adorn a king and guild his crown,
Whose heart went hand in hand even with that vow
He made to you in marriage; and he is dead.
Murd'red, damnably murd'red. This was your husband.
Look you now, here is your husband,
With a face like Vulcan.
A look fit for a murder and a rape,
A dull, dead, hanging look, and a hell-bred eye,
To affright children and amaze the world.
And this same have you left to change with this.
What devil thus hath cozened you at hob-man blind?
Ah! Have you eyes, and can you look on him
That slew my father and your dear husband,
To live in the incestuous pleasure of his bed?
Queen
Oh, Hamlet, speak no more!
Hamlet
To leave him that bare a monarch's mind
For a king of clouts, of very shreds?
Queen
Sweet Hamlet, cease!
Hamlet
Nay, but still to persist and dwell in sin,
To sweat under the yoke of infamy,
To make increase of shame, to seal damnation--
Queen
Hamlet, no more.
Hamlet
Why, appetite with you is in the wane;
Your blood runs backward now from whence it came.
Who'll chide hot blood within a virgin's heart
When lust shall dwell within a matron's breast?
Queen
Hamlet, thou cleaves my heart in twain.
Hamlet
Oh, throw away the worser part of it,
And keep the>better.
Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.
Save me, save me, you gracious
Powers above, and hover over me
With your celestial wings!--
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That I thus long have let revenge slip by?
Oh, do not glare with looks so pitiful,
Lest that my heart of stone yield to compassion,
And every part that should assist revenge
Forgo their proper powers and fall to pity!
Ghost
Hamlet, I once again appear to thee
To put thee in remembrance of my death.
Do not neglect, nor long time put it off.
But I perceive by thy distracted looks
Thy mother's fearful, and she stands amazed.
Speak to her, Hamlet, for her sex is weak.
Comfort thy mother, Hamlet, think on me.
Hamlet
How is't with you, lady?
Queen
Nay, how is't with you
That thus you bend your eyes on vacancy,
And hold discourse with nothing but with air?
Hamlet
Why, do you nothing hear?
Queen
Not I.
Hamlet
Nor do you nothing see?
Queen
No, neither.
Hamlet
No? Why, see the King my father, my father, in the habit
As he lived. Look you how pale he looks!
See how he steals away out of the portal!
Look, there he goes!
Exit Ghost.
Queen
Alas, it is the weakness of thy brain,
Which makes thy tongue to blazon thy heart's grief.
But, as I have a soul, I swear by heaven
I never knew of this most horrid murder.
But Hamlet, this is only fantasy,
And, for my love forget these idle fits.
Hamlet
Idle? No, mother, my pulse doth beat like yours.
It is not madness that possesseth Hamlet.
O mother, if ever you did my dear father love,
Forbear the adulterous bed tonight,
And win yourself by little as you may.
In time it may be you will loathe him quite.
And, mother, but assist me in revenge,
And in his death your infamy shall die.
Queen
Hamlet, I vow, by that Majesty
That knows our thoughts and looks into our hearts,
I will conceal, consent, and do my best,
What stratagem soe'er thou shalt devise.
Hamlet
It is enough. Mother, good night.--
Come, sir, I'll provide for you a grave,
Who was in life a foolish, prating knave.
Exit Hamlet with the dead body.
Enter the King and Lords [Rossencraft and Gilderstone].
King
Now Gertred, what says our son? How do you find him?
Queen
Alas, my lord, as raging as the sea.
Whenas he came, I first bespake him fair,
But then he throws and tosses me about,
As one forgetting that I was his mother.
At last I called for help, and, as I cried, Corambis
Called. Which Hamlet no sooner heard but whips me
Out his rapier, and cries, "A rat, a rat!" and in his rage
The good old man he kills.
King
Why, this his madness will undo our state.
Lords, go to him, inquire the body out.
Gilderstone
We will, my lord.
Exeunt Lords.
King
Gertred, your son shall presently to England.
His shipping is already furnishèd,
And we have sent by Rossencraft and Gilderstone
Our letters to our dear brother of England
For Hamlet's welfare and his happiness.
Haply the air and climate of the country
May please him better than his native home.
See where he comes.
Enter Hamlet and the Lords [Rossencraft, Gilderstone, and perhaps another].
Gilderstone
My lord, we can by no means
Know of him where the body is.
King
Now, son Hamlet, where is this dead body?
Hamlet
At supper, not where he is eating, but
Where he is eaten; a certain company of politic worms are even now at him.
Father, your fat king and your lean beggar
Are but variable services: two dishes to one mess.
Look you, a man may fish with that worm
That hath eaten of a king,
And a beggar eat that fish
Which that worm hath caught.
King
What of this?
Hamlet
Nothing, father, but to tell you, how a king
May go a progress through the guts of a beggar.
King
But son Hamlet, where is this body?
Hamlet
In heav'n. If you chance to miss him there,
Father, you had best look in the other parts below
For him, and if you cannot find him there
You may chance to nose him as you go up the lobby.
King
[To a Lord] Make haste and find him out.
[Exit a Lord.]
Hamlet
[To the Lord, as he exits] Nay, do you hear? Do not make too much haste.
I'll warrant you he'll stay till you come.
King
Well, son Hamlet, we, in care of you, but specially
In tender preservation of your health,
The which we price even as our proper self,
It is our mind you forthwith go for England.
The wind sits fair. You shall aboard tonight.
Lord Rossencraft and Gilderstone shall go along with you.
Hamlet
Oh, with all my heart. Farewell, mother.
King
Your loving father, Hamlet.
Hamlet
My mother, I say. You married my mother,
My mother is your wife; man and wife is one flesh;
And so, my mother, farewell. For England, ho!
Exeunt all but the King [and Queen].
King
Gertred, leave me,
And take your leave of Hamlet.
[Exit Queen.]
To England is he gone, ne'er to return.
Our letters are unto the King of England,
That, on the sight of them, on his allegiance,
He presently, without demanding why,
That Hamlet lose his head, for he must die.
There's more in him than shallow eyes can see.
He once being dead, why then our state is free.
Exit.
[Scene 12]
Enter Fortenbrasse, Drum, and Soldiers.
Fortenbrasse
Captain, from us go greet
The King of Denmark.
Tell him that Fortenbrasse, nephew to old Norway,
Craves a free pass and conduct over his land,
According to the articles agreed on.
You know our rendezvous. Go, march away!
Exeunt all.
[Scene 13]
Enter King and Queen.
King
Hamlet is shipped for England. Fare him well.
I hope to hear good news from thence ere long,
If everything fall out to our content,
As I do make no doubt but so it shall.
Queen
God grant it may. Heav'ns keep my Hamlet safe!
But this mischance of old Corambis' death
Hath piercèd so the young Ofelia's heart
That she, poor maid, is quite bereft her wits.
King
Alas, dear heart! And on the other side
We understand her brother's come from France,
And he hath half the heart of all our land;
And hardly he'll forget his father's death
Unless by some means he be pacified.
Queen
Oh, see where the young Ofelia is!
Enter Ofelia playing on a lute, and her hair down, singing.
Ofelia
[Sings]
How should I your true love know
From another man?
By his cockle hat and his staff,
And his sandal shoon.
White his shroud as mountain snow,
Larded with sweet flowers,
That bewept to the grave did not go
With true lovers' showers.
He is dead and gone, lady,
he is dead and gone.
At his head a grass green turf,
At his heels a stone.
King
How is't with you, sweet Ofelia?
Ofelia
Well, God yield you.
It grieves me to see how they laid him in the cold ground.
I could not choose but weep.
[She sings.]
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he's gone, and we cast away moan,
And he never will come again.
His beard as white as snow;
All flaxen was his poll.
He is dead, he is gone,
And we cast away moan.
God ha' mercy on his soul!
And of all Christen souls, I pray God.
God be with you, ladies, God be with you.
Exit Ofelia.
King
A pretty wretch! This is a change indeed.
O Time, how swiftly runs our joys away!
Content on earth was never certain bred.
Today we laugh and live, tomorrow dead.
How now, what noise is that?
A noise within.
Enter Laertes.
Laertes
[To his followers, who are offstage] Stay there until I come.--
O thou vile king, give me my father!
Speak, say, where's my father?
King
Dead.
Laertes
Who hath murdered him? Speak. I'll not
Be juggled with, for he is murdered.
Queen
True, but not by him.
Laertes
By whom? By heav'n, I'll be resolved.
[The Queen attempts to restrain him.]
King
Let him go, Gertred. Away! I fear him not.
There's such divinity doth wall a king
That treason dares not look on.
Let him go, Gertred.--That your father is murdered,
'Tis true, and we most sorry for it,
Being the chiefest pillar of our state.
Therefore will you, like a most desperate gamester,
Swoopstake-like, draw at friend and foe and all?
Laertes
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope mine arms
And lock them in my heart, but to his foes
I will no reconcilement but by blood.
King
Why, now you speak like a most loving son.
And that in soul we sorrow for his death,
Yourself ere long shall be a witness.
Meanwhile, be patient and content yourself.
Enter Ofelia as before.
Laertes
Who's this, Ofelia? O my dear sister!
Is't possible a young maid's life
Should be as mortal as an old man's saw?
O heav'ns themselves!--How now, Ofelia?
Ofelia
Well, God-a-mercy. I ha' been gathering of flowers.
Here, here is rue for you.
You may call it herb-a-grace o'Sundays.
Here's some for me, too. You must wear your rue
With a difference. There's a daisy.
Here, love, there's rosemary for you
for remembrance. I pray, love, remember.
And there's pansy for thoughts.
Laertes
A document in madness. Thoughts, remembrance!
O God, O God!
Ofelia
There is fennel for you. I would ha' giv'n you
Some violets, but they all withered when
My father died. Alas, they say the owl was
A baker's daughter. We see what we are,
But cannot tell what we shall be.
[She sings]
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
Laertes
Thoughts and afflictions, torments worse than hell!
Ofelia
Nay, love, I pray you make no words of this now.
I pray now, you shall sing "a-down,"
And you "a- down-a." 'Tis o'the King's daughter
And the false steward, and if anybody
Ask you of anything, say you this:
[She sings]
Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day,
All in the morning betime,
And a maid at your window
To be your Valentine.
The young man rose,
And donned his clothes,
And dupped the chamber door,
Let in the maid, that out a maid
Never departed more.
Nay, I pray, mark now:
[She sings]
By Gis and by Saint Charity
Away, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't when they come to't;
By Cock, they are to blame.
Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me,
You promised me to wed."
"So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
If thou hadst not come to my bed."
So, God be with you all. God b'w'y', ladies.
God b'w'y' you, love.
Exit Ofelia.
Laertes
Grief upon grief! My father murdered,
My sister thus distracted:
Cursed be his soul that wrought this wicked act!
King
Content you, good Laertes, for a time,
Although I know your grief is as a flood,
Brimful of sorrow; but forbear awhile,
And think already the revenge is done
On him that makes you such a hapless son.
Laertes
You have prevailed, my lord. Awhile I'll strive
To bury grief within a tomb of wrath,
Which once unhearsed, then the world shall hear
Laertes had a father he held dear.
King
No more of that. Ere many days be done,
You shall hear that you do not dream upon.
Exeunt omnes.
[Scene 14]
Enter Horatio [with a letter] and the Queen.
Horatio
Madam, your son is safe arrived in Denmark.
This letter I even now received of him,
Whereas he writes how he escaped the danger
And subtle treason that the King had plotted.
Being crossed by the contention of the winds,
He found the packet sent to the King of England,
Wherein he saw himself betrayed to death,
As, at his next convers'ion with your grace,
He will relate the circumstance at full.
Queen
Then I perceive there's treason in his looks
That seemed to sugar o'er his villainy.
But I will soothe and please him for a time,
For murderous minds are always jealous.
But know not you, Horatio, where he is?
Horatio
Yes, madam, and he hath appointed me
To meet him on the east side of the city
Tomorrow morning.
Queen
Oh, fail not, good Horatio, and withal commend me
A mother's care to him. Bid him awhile
Be wary of his presence, lest that he
Fail in that he goes about.
Horatio
Madam, never make doubt of that.
I think by this the news be come to court:
He is arrived. Observe the King, and you shall
Quickly find, Hamlet being here,
Things fell not to his mind.
Queen
But what become of Gilderstone and Rossencraft?
Horatio
He being set ashore, they went for England,
And in the packet there writ down that doom
To be performed on them 'pointed for him.
And by great chance he had his father's seal,
So all was done without discovery.
Queen
Thanks be to heaven for blessing of the Prince!
Horatio, once again I take my leave,
With thousand mother's blessings to my son.
Horatio
Madam, adieu.
[Exeunt.]
[Scene 15]
Enter King and Laertes.
King
Hamlet from England! Is it possible?
What chance is this? They are gone, and he come home!
Laertes
Oh, he is welcome, by my soul he is!
At it my jocund heart doth leap for joy,
That I shall live to tell him: thus he dies.
King
Laertes, content yourself. Be ruled by me,
And you shall have no let for your revenge.
Laertes
My will, not all the world.
King
Nay, but Laertes, mark the plot I have laid:
I have heard him often, with a greedy wish,
Upon some praise that he hath heard of you
Touching your weapon, wish with all his heart
He might be once tasked for to try your cunning.
Laertes
And how for this?
King
Marry, Laertes, thus: I'll lay a wager,
Shall be on Hamlet's side, and you shall give the odds,
The which will draw him with a more desire
To try the maistry, that in twelve venies
You gain not three of him. Now, this being granted,
When you are hot in midst of all your play,
Among the foils shall a keen rapier lie,
Steeped in a mixture of deadly poison
That, if it draws but the least dram of blood
In any part of him, he cannot live.
This being done will free you from suspicion,
And not the dearest friend that Hamlet loved
Will ever have Laertes in suspect.
Laertes
My lord, I like it well.
But say Lord Hamlet should refuse this match?
King
I'll warrant you, we'll put on you
Such a report of singularity
Will bring him on, although against his will.
And, lest that all should miss,
I'll have a potion that shall ready stand,
In all his heat when that he calls for drink,
Shall be his period and our happiness.
Laertes
'Tis excellent. Oh, would the time were come!
Here comes the Queen.
Enter the Queen.
King
How now, Gertred, why look you heavily?
Queen
O my lord, the young Ofelia,
Having made a garland of sundry sorts of flowers,
Sitting upon a willow by a brook,
The envious sprig broke. Into the brook she fell,
And for a while her clothes, spread wide abroad,
Bore the young lady up; and there she sat smiling,
Even mermaid-like, 'twixt heaven and earth,
Chanting old sundry tunes, uncapable,
As it were, of her distress. But long it could not be
Till that her clothes, being heavy with their drink,
Dragged the sweet wretch to death.
Laertes
So, she is drowned.
Too much of water hast thou, Ofelia;
Therefore I will not drown thee in my tears.
Revenge it is must yield this heart relief,
For woe begets woe, and grief hangs on grief.
Exeunt.
[Scene 16]
Enter Clown [Gravedigger] and another.
1 Clown
I say no, she ought not to be buried
In Christian burial.
2 Clown
Why, sir?
1 Clown
Marry, because she's drowned.
2 Clown
But she did not drown herself.
1 Clown
No, that's certain, the water drowned her.
2 Clown
Yea, but it was against her will.
1 Clown
No, I deny that, for look you, sir, I stand here.
If the water come to me, I drown not myself.
But if I go to the water, and am there drowned,
Ergo I am guilty of my own death.
Y'are gone, go, y'are gone, sir.
2 Clown
Ay, but see, she hath Christian burial,
Because she is a great woman.
1 Clown
Marry, more's the pity that great folk
Should have more authority to hang or drown
Themselves more than other people.
Go fetch me a stoup of drink. But before thou
Goest, tell me one thing: who builds strongest
Of a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
2 Clown
Why, a mason, for he builds all of stone,
And will endure long.
1 Clown
That's pretty. To't again, to't again.
2 Clown
Why, then, a carpenter, for he builds the gallows,
And that brings many a one to his long home.
1 Clown
Pretty again. The gallows doth well. Marry, how does it well? The gallows does well to them that do ill. Go get thee gone.
And if anyone ask thee hereafter, say,
A grave-maker, for the houses he builds
Last till Doomsday. Fetch me a stoup of beer, go.
[Exit Second Clown.]
Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
1 Clown
[He sings.]
A pick-ax and a spade,
A spade, for and a winding sheet,
Most fit it is, for 'twill be made
He throws up a shovel.
For such a guest most meet.
Hamlet
Hath this fellow any feeling of himself,
That is thus merry in making of a grave?
See how the slave jowls their heads against the earth!
Horatio
My lord, custom hath made it in him seem nothing.
1 Clown[He sings.]
A pick-ax and a spade, a spade,
For and a winding sheet,
Most fit it is for to be made
For such a guest most meet.
[He throws up skull.]
Hamlet
Look you, there's another, Horatio.
Why may't not be the skull of some lawyer?
Methinks he should indict that fellow
Of an action of battery, for knocking
Him about the pate with's shovel. Now where is your
Quirks and quillets now, your vouchers and
Double vouchers, your leases and freehold
And tenements? Why, that same box there will scarce
Hold the conveyance of his land, and must
The honor lie there? Oh, pitiful transformance!
I prithee tell me, Horatio,
Is parchment made of sheepskins?
Horatio
Ay, my lord, and of calves' skins too.
Hamlet
I'faith, they prove themselves sheep and calves
That deal with them, or put their trust in them.
[The Gravedigger throws up another skull.]
There's another. Why may not that be Such-a-one's
Skull, that praised my Lord Such-a-one's horse
When he meant to beg him? Horatio, I prithee
Let's question yonder fellow. --
Now, my friend, whose grave is this?
1 Clown
Mine, sir.
Hamlet
But who must lie in it?
1 Clown
If I should say I should, I should lie in my throat, sir.
Hamlet
What man must be buried here?
1 Clown
No man, sir.
Hamlet
What woman?
1 Clown
No woman neither, sir, but indeed
One that was a woman.
Hamlet
An excellent fellow, by the Lord, Horatio.
This seven years have I noted it: the toe of the peasant
Comes so near the heel of the courtier
That he galls his kibe. [To the Gravedigger] I prithee tell me one thing:
How long will a man lie in the ground before he rots?
1 Clown
I'faith, sir, if he be not rotten before
He be laid in, as we have many pocky corses,
He will last you eight years. A tanner
Will last you eight years full out, or nine.
Hamlet
And why a tanner?
1 Clown
Why, his hide is so tanned with his trade
That it will hold out water, that's a parlous
Devourer of your dead body, a great soaker.
[He picks up a skull.]
Look you, here's a skull hath been here this dozen year--
Let me see, ay, ever since our last king Hamlet
Slew Fortenbrasse in combat, young Hamlet's father,
He that's mad.
Hamlet
Ay, marry, how came he mad?
1 Clown
I'faith, very strangely: by losing of his wits.
Hamlet
Upon what ground?
1 Clown
O' this ground, in Denmark.
Hamlet
Where is he now?
1 Clown
Why, now they sent him to England.
Hamlet
To England! Wherefore?
1 Clown
Why, they say he shall have his wits there.
Or if he have not, 'tis no great matter there.
It will not be seen there.
Hamlet
Why not there?
1 Clown
Why, there, they say, the men are as mad as he.
Hamlet
Whose skull was this?
1 Clown
This? A plague on him, a mad rogue's it was.
He poured once a whole flagon of Rhenish of my head.
Why, do not you know him? This was one Yorick's skull.
Hamlet
Was this? I prithee let me see it. [He takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!
I knew him, Horatio.
A fellow of infinite mirth. He hath carried me twenty times upon his back. Here hung those lips that I have kissed a hundred times, and to see, now they abhor me.--Where's your jests now, Yorick? Your flashes of merriment? Now go to my lady's chamber and bid her paint herself an inch thick, to this she must come, Yorick.--Horatio, I prithee tell me one thing. Dost thou think that Alexander looked thus?
Horatio
Even so, my lord.
Hamlet
And smelt thus?
Horatio
Ay, my lord, no otherwise.
Hamlet
No? Why might not imagination work as thus of Alexander: Alexander died. Alexander was buried. Alexander became earth. Of earth we make clay. And Alexander being but clay, why might not time bring to pass that he might stop the bunghole of a beer-barrel?
Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
Enter King and Queen, Laertes, and other Lords, with a Priest after the coffin.
Hamlet
What funeral's this that all the court laments?
It shows to be some noble parentage.
Stand by awhile.
[Hamlet and Horatio conceal themselves.]
Laertes
What ceremony else? Say, what ceremony else?
Priest
My lord, we have done all that lies in us,
And more than well the church can tolerate.
She hath had a dirge sung for her maiden soul;
And, but for favor of the King and you,
She had been buried in the open fields,
Where now she is allowed Christian burial.
Laertes
So? I tell thee, churlish priest, a ministr'ing angelshall my sister be when thou liest howling.
Hamlet [To Horatio] The fair Ofelia dead!
Queen
Sweets to the sweet, farewell!
I had thought to adorn thy bridal bed, fair maid,
And not to follow thee unto thy grave.
Laertes
Forbear the earth awhile. Sister, farewell.
Laertes leaps into the grave.
Now pour your earth on, Olympus-high,
And make a hill to o'ertop old Pelion!
Hamlet leaps in after Laertes.
TLN n="3449"/>HamletWhat's he that conjures so?
Behold, 'tis I, Hamlet the Dane.
Laertes
The devil take thy soul!
Hamlet
Oh, thou prayest not well.
I prithee take thy hand from off my throat,
For there is something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
I loved Ofelia as dear as twenty brothers could.
Show me what thou wilt do for her.
Wilt fight? Wilt fast? Wilt pray?
Wilt drink up vessels? Eat a crocodile? I'll do't.
Com'st thou here to whine?
And where thou talk'st of burying thee alive,
Here let us stand, and let them throw on us
Whole hills of earth, till with the height thereof
Make Oosell as a wart!
King
Forbear, Laertes. Now is he mad as is the sea,
Anon as mild and gentle as a dove.
Therefore awhile give his wild humor scope.
Hamlet
[To Laertes] What is the reason, sir, that you wrong me thus?
I never gave you cause. But stand away.
A cat will mew, a dog will have a day.
Exit Hamlet and Horatio.
Queen
Alas, it is his madness makes him thus,
And not his heart, Laertes.
King
[To Laertes] My lord, 'tis so. [Aside to him] But we'll no longer trifle.
This very day shall Hamlet drink his last,
For presently we mean to send to him.
Therefore, Laertes, be in readiness.
Laertes [Aside to the King]
My lord, till then my soul will not be quiet.
King
Come Gertred, we'll have Laertes and our son
Made friends and lovers, as befits them both,
Even as they tender us and love their country.
Queen
God grant they may!
Exeunt omnes.
[Scene 17]
Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
Hamlet
Believe me, it grieves me much, Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
For by myself methinks I feel his grief,
Though there's a difference in each other's wrong.
Enter a Braggart Gentleman.
Horatio, but mark yon water-fly.
The Court knows him, but he knows not the Court.
Gentleman
Now God save thee, sweet prince Hamlet!
Hamlet
And you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Foh, how the musk-cod smells!
Gentleman
I come with an embassage from his majesty to you.
Hamlet
I shall, sir, give you attention.
By my troth, methinks 'tis very cold.
Gentleman
It is indeed very rawish cold.
Hamlet
'Tis hot, methinks.
Gentleman
Very swoltery hot.
The King, sweet Prince, hath laid a wager on your side:
Six Barbary horse against six French rapiers,
With all their accoutrements too, o'the carriages.
In good faith, they are very curiously wrought.
Hamlet
The carriages, sir? I do not know what you mean.
Gentleman
The girdles and hangers, sir, and such like.
Hamlet
The word had been more cousin-german to the phrase if he could have carried the cannon by his side.
And how's the wager? I understand you now.
Gentleman
Marry, sir, that young Laertes in twelve venies
At rapier and dagger do not get three odds of you;
And on your side the King hath laid,
and desires you to be in readiness.
Hamlet
Very well. If the King dare venture his wager,
I dare venture my skull. When must this be?
Gentleman
My lord, presently. The King and her majesty,
With the rest of the best judgment in the Court,
Are coming down into the outward palace.
Hamlet
Go tell his majesty I will attend him.
Gentleman
I shall deliver your most sweet answer.
Exit.
Hamlet
You may, sir, none better, for y'are spiced!
Else he had a bad nose could not smell a fool.
Horatio
He will disclose himself without inquiry.
Hamlet
Believe me, Horatio, my heart is on the sudden
Very sore all hereabout.
Horatio
My lord, forbear the challenge, then.
Hamlet
No Horatio, not I. If danger be now,
Why then it is not to come. There's a predestinate providence in the fall of a sparrow. Here comes the King.
Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords.
King
Now, son Hamlet, we have laid upon your head,
And make no question but to have the best.
Hamlet
Your majesty hath laid o'the weaker side.
King
We doubt it not.--Deliver them the foils.
Hamlet
First, Laertes, here's my hand and love,
Protesting that I never wronged Laertes.
If Hamlet in his madness did amiss,
That was not Hamlet, but his madness did it,
And all the wrong I e'er did to Laertes
I here proclaim was madness. Therefore let's be at peace,
And think I have shot mine arrow o'er the house
And hurt my brother.
Laertes
Sir I am satisfied in nature,
But in terms of honor I'll stand aloof,
And will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters of our time
I may be satisfied.
King
Give them the foils.
Hamlet
I'll be your foil, Laertes. These foils
Have all a length? Come on, sir. Here they play. A hit!
Laertes
No, none.
Hamlet
Judgment?
Gentleman
A hit, a most palpable hit.
Laertes
Well, come again.
They play again.
Hamlet
Another. Judgment?
Laertes
Ay, I grant, a touch, a touch.
King
Here, Hamlet, the King doth drink a health to thee.
Queen
Here Hamlet, take my napkin, wipe thy face.
King
Give him the wine.
Hamlet
Set it by. I'll have another bout first.
I'll drink anon.
Queen
Here, Hamlet, thy mother drinks to thee.
She drinks.
King
Do not drink, Gertred. [Aside] Oh, 'tis the poisoned cup!
Hamlet
Laertes, come, you dally with me.
I pray you, pass with your most cunning'st play.
Laertes
Ay? Say you so? Have at you.
I'll hit you now, my lord.
[Aside] And yet it goes almost against my conscience.
Hamlet
Come on, sir.
They catch one another's rapiers, and both are wounded. Laertes falls down. The Queen falls down and dies.
King
Look to the Queen!
Queen
Oh, the drink, the drink, Hamlet, the drink!
[She dies.]
Hamlet
Treason, ho! Keep the gates!
Lords
How is't, my lord Laertes?
Laertes
Even as a coxcomb should,
Foolishly slain with my own weapon.
Hamlet, thou hast not in thee half an hour of life;
The fatal instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenomed. Thy mother's poisoned.
That drink was made for thee.
Hamlet
The poisoned instrument within my hand?
Then, venom, to thy venom. Die, damnèd villain!
[He stabs the King and then forces him to drink from the poisoned cup.]
Come, drink. Here lies thy union, here!
The King dies.
Laertes
Oh, he is justly served.
Hamlet, before I die, here take my hand,
And, withal, my love. I do forgive thee.
Laertes dies.
Hamlet
And I thee. Oh, I am dead, Horatio. Fare thee well.
Horatio
No, I am more an antique Roman
Than a Dane. Here is some poison left.
Hamlet
Upon my love, I charge thee let it go.
Oh, fie, Horatio, an if thou shouldest die,
What a scandal wouldst thou leave behind?
What tongue should tell the story of our deaths,
If not from thee? Oh, my heart sinks, Horatio.
Mine eyes have lost their sight, my tongue his use.
Farewell, Horatio. Heaven receive my soul!
Hamlet dies.
Enter Voltemar and the Ambassadors from England. Enter Fortenbrasse with his train.
Fortenbrasse
Where is this bloody sight?
Horatio
If aught of woe or wonder you'd behold,
Then look upon this tragic spectacle.
Fortenbrasse
O imperious Death! How many princes
Hast thou at one draught bloodily shot to death!
Ambassador
Our embassy that we have brought from England,
Where be these princes that should hear us speak?
Oh, most most unlooked-for time! Unhappy country!
Horatio
Content yourselves. I'll show to all the ground,
The first beginning of this tragedy.
Let there a scaffold be reared up in the marketplace,
And let the state of the world be there,
Where you shall hear such a sad story told
That never mortal man could more unfold.
Fortenbrasse
I have some rights of memory to this kingdom,
Which now to claim my leisure doth invite me.
Let four of our chiefest captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to his grave;
For he was likely, had he lived,
To ha' proved most royal.
Take up the body. Such a sight as this
Becomes the fields, but here doth much amiss.
[Exeunt.]
